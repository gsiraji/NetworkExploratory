# NetworkExploratory

This repository contains script used in exploring research questions on self criticality, networks, and phase transitions that never got published. 

The scripts are mostly attempts at understanding simple solvable toy models in my first year of research as a grad student. Abelian Sandpile Models are especially fascinating.

Check out Figure 2 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09153.pdf for some incredible math that's also art


community: applying network community concepts to fluid flow networks


psynG and synthetics: synthetic networks similar to fluid networks created by packings of spherical beads. Ran well on R2020b, but I suspect issues running on later MATLAB versions
